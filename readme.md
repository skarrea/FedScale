Abstract:

Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity, emphasizing the need for accurate and non-invasive diagnostic tools. While deep learning models have advanced PCa detection in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they often fail to integrate anatomical knowledge. This study evaluates U-Mamba, a deep learning architecture designed to enhance long-range dependency modeling with linear time complexity, for PCa detection. Furthermore, a multi-task learning (MTL) extension, U-Mamba MTL, is introduced to incorporate prostate zonal anatomy, aligning with clinical diagnostic work-flows. The models were assessed using diverse datasets, including the PI-CAI hidden tuning cohort (N=100) and an in-house collected out-of-distribution cohort (N=200). Results demonstrate that U-Mamba achieves robust state-of-the-art detection performance, while U-Mamba MTL further improves PCa detection through the auxiliary zonal segmentation task. These findings highlight the potential of integrating U-Mamba with anatomical context to improve PCa detection.




## How to install:
```
conda env create --file=environment.yml
conda activate umamba_mtl
wandb login # Logging into weights and biases (required for logging during model training)
```

This will install all packages needed to run the experiments, including the shared modules in /shared_modules.
A shared module can be loaded like this:

```
from shared_modules.networks.UMambaBot_3d_mtl.py
```

## Download weights (optional):

You may choose which weights to download by changing the variables inside ``utils/download_weights.py`` (defaults to umamba_mtl only).

```
cd utils
python download_weights.py
```


## Datasets

The repository expects the datasets to be located in ``data/``. The datasets (except for our in-house dataset) can be downloaded from:

- PI-CAI dataset: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6624726.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6624726)
- PI-CAI labels: https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/picai_labels
- Prostate158 (training): [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6481141.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6481141)
- Prostate158 (testing): [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6592345.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6592345)
- ProstateX: Is a subset of PI-CAI

You can either make your own json datalists or use the existing lists in ``json_datalists/{dataset_id}/``.
Instructions for PI-CAI training set download and preprossessing can be seen in ``data/PI-CAI-V2.0/readme.md``.

### Create datalists from splits

`shared_modules.datalists` provides `load_case_info`, `create_datalists`, and
`write_datalists` using only Python's standard library. The splits JSON is an
array of folds, each containing `train` and `val` lists:

```json
[
    {"train": ["10000_1000000"], "val": ["10001_1000001"]},
    {"train": ["10001_1000001"], "val": ["10000_1000000"]}
]
```

Identifiers can also be patient IDs, such as `"10000"` or `10000`; these expand
to all studies belonging to that patient in the CSV. CSV columns `patient_id`
and `study_id` are required. Optional `case_csPCa` values `YES`/`NO` are exported
as `case_pca` values 1/0. Other clinical CSV fields are not exported. IDs retain
leading zeros when provided as strings. Unknown IDs, duplicate cases, and
patients appearing in both training and validation within a fold are rejected.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python -m shared_modules.datalists \
    --splits /path/to/splits.json \
    --cases-csv /path/to/cases.csv \
    --images-dir MyDataset/imagesTR \
    --labels-dir MyDataset/labelsTr \
    --prostate-dir MyDataset/whole_gland \
    --output-dir json_datalists/MyDataset
```

This writes `fold_0.json`, `fold_1.json`, etc., replacing existing files with
those names. Each contains `training`, `validation`, and an empty `test` list.
Patient entries contain `image` (three paths), `pca`, and `case_pca` if available.
Providing `--prostate-dir` also adds `prostate`, the whole-gland segmentation
path, with filenames `{patient_id}_{study_id}.nii.gz`.
Images are named `{patient_id}_{study_id}_0000.nii.gz`, `_0001.nii.gz`, and
`_0002.nii.gz`, in T2W, ADC, HBV order. Labels are named
`{patient_id}_{study_id}.nii.gz`. Use `--sequence-ids` to change sequence numbers
while preserving that channel order. Directory spelling and case are preserved.

Paths are stored as supplied. Relative image and mask directories should be
relative to the training config's `data.data_dir`, not the output JSON directory.
Use `--check-files --data-dir /path/to/data` to verify all referenced files.
Negative cases still require an existing empty cancer-label file; the utility
does not generate masks.

For prostate-based cropping, add `--prostate-pred-dir MyDataset/prostate_preds`.
Prediction filenames default to `{patient_id}_{study_id}_pred.nii.gz`; use
`--prostate-pred-suffix ''` for `{patient_id}_{study_id}.nii.gz` instead.
For MTL, also add `--zones-dir MyDataset/zones`, whose mask filenames are
`{patient_id}_{study_id}.nii.gz`.

Without prostate predictions, set `transforms.crop_key: null` and remove
`prostate_pred` from `transforms.label_keys`. For non-MTL use `label_keys: ["pca"]`;
for MTL use `label_keys: ["pca", "zones"]` and provide `--zones-dir`.

The same functions can be called from Python:

```python
from shared_modules.datalists import create_datalists, write_datalists

datalists = create_datalists(
    "splits.json", "cases.csv", "MyDataset/imagesTR", "MyDataset/labelsTr",
    prostate_dir="MyDataset/whole_gland",
    # zones_dir="MyDataset/zones",  # required for MTL
    # prostate_pred_dir="MyDataset/prostate_preds",  # for prostate-based cropping
)
write_datalists(datalists, "json_datalists/MyDataset")
```


## Local training and testing

Inside the experiments folder you will find the code for training and testing for each model (except for PI-CAI baselines).

**Configuration:**

``config.yaml`` contains the configuration for training and inference

Please note that Weights and Biases is currently used to log metrics while training. 
Replace the ``logger.project`` and ``logger.entity`` with your own wandb information, inside the ``config.yaml``, before running the trainer.


**Model training:**

Model training can be started using:

```
python trainer.py
```

**Model Assessment:**

Run the code blocks inside ``evaluate_ensemble.ipynb``
Please note that the evaluation script is set to calculate metrics on the PI-CAI training set (N=1500) as our in-house dataset is not publicly available. Although the PI-CAI training set is resampled to T2W spacing using picai_prep, the dataloader can do this on the fly by providing ["t2w","adc","hbv"] seperatily instead of ["image"].

## PI-CAI Docker Submission ##

The docker submissions for PI-CAI is structured as a base-container + specific models as tar files.

The base container can be built using the following command (within the ``gc_algorithms/base_container`` folder):

```
chmod +x build.sh
chmod +x export.sh
./export.sh
```


A spesific model can be compressed using the following command (within the ``gc_algorithms/base_container/models`` folder):
Each of these models does rely on a U-Mamba prostate segmentation model for prostate center cropping.

```
tar -czvf swin_unetr.tar.gz -C swin_unetr .
tar -czvf umamba.tar.gz -C umamba .
tar -czvf umamba_mtl.tar.gz -C umamba_mtl .
```

These files includes the model weights and the inference script for each model.
These models can then be uploaded into the algorithm on the grand challenge website.
